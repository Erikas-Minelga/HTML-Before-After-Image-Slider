# HTML-Before-After-Image-Slider
An HTML5 Before/After Image Slider implemented using HTML5 Canvas and Javascript. The slider works by hiding a part of one image and exposing more of the other depending on the position of the slider. 

2 images have been provided along with the source code, but any 2 images can be used with this, as long as they are the same size. Canvas also needs to be set to the same size as the images. 

So far, the image slider itself cannot be customised. I do however have intentions to make this into a framework to add more flexibility and customisation options to this slider.
